# Diversity measures

We explore how the *classic* diversity measures relate to the *modern* hill-numbers based metrics, which reflect the *effective number of species* in the community

We first simulate a community with known SAD (species abundance distribution), and calculate taxon richness, and classic Shannon, and Simpson diversity. Then we remove half of the taxa (randomly) and re-quantify diversity metrics, using both classic and hill-numbers based diversity metrics.
