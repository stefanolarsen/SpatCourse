# SpatCourse
Intro to spatial autocorrelation with focus on river networks

There are several .Rmd script files prepared for the Advanced Course in Biodiversity and Ecosystem Functioning @CBMA, University of Minho

- SpatCourse_diversity.Rmd - briefly introduce the use of hill numbers and the 'effective number of species' concept for diversity estimates.
- SpatCourse_spatial.Rmd - provides examples for simulating and accounting for spatial (temporal) autocorrelation using GLS.
- SpatCourse_spatial2.Rmd - With examples for simulating different autocorrelated landscapes and exploring patterns with variograms.
- SpatCourse_SSN1 - Spatial Stream Network models examples using the Adige River data; Fitting variograms and models.
- SpatCourse_SSN2 - SSN examples using the SSN package data; Fitting models, and making predictions.
- SpatCourse.ssn.RData - an R dataset with spatial data from the Adige river networks as .ssn object (Spatial Stream Network). *The dataset is not working!*
